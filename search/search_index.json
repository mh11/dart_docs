Rapid identification of the causal mutation(s) provides a molecular diagnosis that can inform potentially invasive treatment decisions and reduces the need for lengthy (and often costly) testing. Genetic diagnoses are currently hampered by the large number of potential disease genes, by the high number of variants identified and by the complexity of variant annotation, which can lead to major delays in reaching a confident genetic diagnosis. Reporting variants DART is a user-friendly, non-commercial software tool that assists researchers and clinicians with the filtering and interpretation of genetic variants obtained by next generation sequencing (e.g. diagnostic panels, exome sequencing, or whole genome sequencing. DART facilitates confident genetic diagnoses in compliance with emerging community standards. Starting with an annotated VCF file, DART supports interactive filtering, implements ACMG- AMP classification, provides full audit history, and helps generate custom patient reports. Going the extra mile Starting with an annotated VCF file, DART supports the user by providing Sample focused analysis Virtual gene panels Standardized filtering Interactive exploration and visualization of variants Disease focused variant analysis Trio / relatedness variant representation Support ACMG-AMP variant curation Full control DART rivals commercial variant annotation software in terms of features and user-friendliness, and \u2013 as an open source software with no strings attached \u2013 it puts the full control over genetic data back in the hands of the clinical laboratories that analyse the data.

Sample selection An identifier is searched across all accessible variant files and can be further refined by the file name, date, sample type or reference genome. Virtual Gene Panel Disease specific panels can be pre-defined in DART to provide patient relevant analyses. Panels can be defined as HGNC gene names or as genomic relevant regions. The use of panels can be enforced to prevent secondary findings. Standardised filtering Disease specific filtering strategies can be prepared to allow for different modes of inheritance (e.g. dominant, recessive) and expected frequency in the population. Query status Query result Variants passing the filter criteria are displayed one per row and can be interactively explored (sorted, filtered, \u2026). Variant details Compact visual variant representation allows an efficient analysis of clinical relevance. Disease focus Disease context specific analysis of a patient enables the clinical assessment of variants for the selected disease(s). Previous variant annotations are displayed and highlighted depending on the disease focus. Variant curation DART supports the ACMG-AMP (link) annotation of variants in the disease context. Variant curations are stored at your institution in DART as a knowledge base and provided as guidance across samples and diseases.
